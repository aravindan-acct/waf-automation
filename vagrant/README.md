# Introduction

In a nutshell, Vagrant is a tool for working with virtual environments, and in most circumstances, this means working with virtual machines. Vagrant provides a simple and easy to use command-line client for managing these environments, and an interpreter for the text-based definitions of what each environment looks like, called Vagrantfiles. Vagrant is open source, which means that anyone can download it, modify it, and share it freely.

# Why Vagrant?

Most of the devops tools we use commonly need different dependent software to be installed. We also need to install work flow specific software. It helps to have a Vagrant box that can boot up with all these software installed during bootup aka bootstrapping. We provide access to vagrantfiles that will have bootstrapping code.
