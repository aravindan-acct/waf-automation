# Introduction

Take advantage of auto-scaling by deploying the Barracuda Web Application Firewall clusters in an auto-scaling group on AWS.

Build a multi-tier redundant architecture that allows you to independently scale each tier based on your requirements.
Automatically scale based on metrics or a schedule to meet business needs. (An example of metric based scaling is an increase in traffic load; an example of scheduled scaling is to meet a planned traffic increase during a sale or holiday.)
